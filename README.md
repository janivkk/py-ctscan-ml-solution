# A Deep Learning-Based Software Solution for CT Scan Classification

This paper examines the role of deep learning applied in medical setting, notably with
an attempt to detect; by highlighting regions of interest of intracranial haemorrhages for the
purpose of diagnosis and binary classification. Haemorrhagic strokes are a leading mortality
cause affecting 13.7 million people with 5.5 million deaths annually. Data was accumulated
from public and academic database source Kaggle, no human participants were identified nor
used and the scans collected are owned by a third-party. To carry out the solution with regulated
momentum a waterfall methodology was adapted for the target of completing the artefact.
Results were gathered by training the deep-learning classifier on firstly, ~200 samples on 200
epoch which yield wrong class predictions. Secondly, a larger dataset was used ~7000 samples
each split to 0.7 training and 0.3 testing split sets which achieved high accuracy, precision, and
recall metrics at 20 epochs. Lastly, same samples were used at lower epoch ~5, to introduce
some bias and increase justification argument and transparency of the model, on average the
metrics deemed more realistic with value set at 0.98 recall and 0.99 everywhere else. To
conclude, artefact successfully justified the aim for this paper but also unravels unanswered
questions in adapting existing machine models for different problem settings. It is insistent to
keep researching this field as deep learning possesâ€™ issues that need to be addressed.
